Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on building systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with generative AI to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

Multimodal AI systems can process and understand information from multiple data types such as text, images, audio, and video.
