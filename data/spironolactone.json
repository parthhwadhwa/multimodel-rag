  "uses": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Spironolactone tablets are an aldosterone antagonist indicated for: The treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure ( 1.1 ). Use as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions ( 1.2 ). The management of edema in adult patients who are cirrhotic when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restrictions and in the setting of nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response ( 1.3 ). Treatment of primary hyperaldosternism for: ( 1.4 ) Short-term preoperative treatment Long-term maintenance for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are...",
  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily ( 2.2 ). Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 mg to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses ( 2.3 ). Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses ( 2. 4). Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 mg to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient ( 2. 5). 2.1 General Considerations Spironolactone tablets can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure In patients with serum potassium \u2264 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who...",
  "common_side_effects": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Gynecomastia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Impaired neurological function/coma in patients with hepatic impairment, cirrhosis and ascites [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of spironolactone were identified in clinical trials or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Digestive: Gastric bleeding, ulceration, gastritis, diarrhea and cramping, nausea, vomiting. Reproductive: Decreased libido, inability to achieve or maintain erection, irregular menses or amenorrhea, postmenopausal bleeding, breast and nipple pain. Hematologic: Leukopenia (including agranulocytosis), thrombocytopenia....",
  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperkalemia: Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation and regularly thereafter ( 5.1 ). Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function: Monitor volume status and renal function periodically ( 5.2 ). Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid and blood glucose periodically ( 5.3 ). Gynecomastia: Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hyperkalemia Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. This risk is increased by impaired renal function or concomitant potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes or drugs that increase potassium, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Monitor serum potassium within 1 week of initiation or titration of spironolactone and regularly thereafter. More frequent monitoring may be needed when spironolactone is given with other drugs that cause hyperkalemia or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, decrease the dose or discontinue spironolactone and treat hyperkalemia. 5.2...",
