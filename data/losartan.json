  "uses": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Losartan potassium tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: \u2022 Treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children greater than 6 years old. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1.1) \u2022 Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients. (1.2) \u2022 Treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. (1.3) 1.1 Hypertension Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits...",
  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension \u2022 Usual adult dose: 50 mg once daily. (2.1) \u2022 Usual pediatric starting dose: 0.7 mg per kg once daily (up to 50 mg). (2.1) Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy \u2022 Usual starting dose: 50 mg once daily. (2.2) \u2022 Add hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and/or increase losartan potassium to 100 mg followed by an increase to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg if further blood pressure response is needed. (2.2 , 14.2) Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients \u2022 Usual dose: 50 mg once daily. (2.3) \u2022 Increase dose to 100 mg once daily if further blood pressure response is needed. (2.3) 2.1 Hypertension Adult Hypertension The usual starting dose of losartan potassium tablets is 50 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased to a maximum dose of 100 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. A starting dose...",
  "common_side_effects": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22652% and greater than placebo) are: dizziness, upper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and back pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension Losartan potassium has been evaluated for safety in more than 3300 adult patients treated for essential hypertension and 4058 patients/subjects overall. Over 1200 patients were treated for over 6 months and more than 800 for over one year. Treatment with losartan potassium was well-tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation...",
  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium. (5.2) \u2022 Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. (5.3 , 5.4) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Losartan potassium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue losartan potassium as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur...",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Losartan potassium is contraindicated: \u2022 In patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. \u2022 For coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. \u2022 Hypersensitivity to any component. (4) \u2022 Coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. (4)",
  "warnings": "WARNING: FETAL TOXICITY When pregnancy is detected, discontinue losartan potassium as soon as possible. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. WARNING: FETAL TOXICITY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue losartan potassium as soon as possible. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus. (5.1)",
