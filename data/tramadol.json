  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1, 5) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1, 5.1) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial...",

  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (5.8) Serotonin Syndrome : Potentially life-threatening condition could result from concomitant serotonergic drug administration. Discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (5.9) Increased Risk of Seizures : Present within recommended dosage range. Risk is increased with higher than recommended doses and concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, anorectics, tricyclic antidepressants and other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics, other drugs that reduce seizure threshold, in patients with epilepsy or at risk for seizures. (5.10, 7) Risk of Suicide : Do not use tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in suicidal or addiction-prone patients. Use with caution in those taking tranquilizers, antidepressants...",
