In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam tablets may be useful. Some loss of effect may occur during the course of clonazepam treatment (see PRECAUTIONS : Loss of Effect ). Panic Disorder: Clonazepam tablets are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of clonazepam tablets was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder...",
  "dosage_info": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Clonazepam is available as a tablet. The tablets should be administered with water by swallowing the tablet whole. Seizure Disorders: The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of CNS depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam tablets to an existing anticonvulsant regimen. Adults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg. Pediatric Patients: Clonazepam tablets are administered orally.
