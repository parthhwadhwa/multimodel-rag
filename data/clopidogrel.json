  "uses": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clopidogrel tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated for: Acute coronary syndrome \u2013 For patients with non\u2013ST-segment elevation ACS (unstable angina [UA]/non\u2013ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]), clopidogrel tablets have been shown to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. (1.1) \u2013 For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), clopidogrel tablets have been shown to reduce the rate of MI and stroke. (1.1) Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel tablets have been shown to reduce the rate of MI and stroke. (1.2) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Clopidogrel tablets are indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with non\u2013ST-segment elevation ACS (unstable angina [UA]/non\u2013ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]), including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization. Clopidogrel tablets should be administered in conjunction with aspirin. Clopidogrel...",
  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Acute coronary syndrome ( 2.1 ) \u2013 Initiate clopidogrel tablets with a single 300 mg oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. \u2013 Initiating clopidogrel tablets without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days. Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease: 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel tablets with a single 300 mg oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiating clopidogrel tablets without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose [see Clinical Pharmacology...",
  "common_side_effects": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow-up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for one year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing clopidogrel plus aspirin to placebo...",
  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CYP2C19 inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole. (5.1) Bleeding: Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding. (5.2) Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. ( 5.3 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning ] . The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see Drug...",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage (4.1) Hypersensitivity to clopidogrel or any component of the product (4.2) 4.1 Active Bleeding Clopidogrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage. 4.2 Hypersensitivity Clopidogrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to clopidogrel or any component of the product [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .",
  "warnings": "WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE The effectiveness of clopidogrel results from its antiplatelet activity, which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Clopidogrel at recommended doses forms less of the active metabolite and so has a reduced effect on platelet activity in patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene, (termed \u201cCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\u201d). Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Consider use of another platelet P2Y 12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Effectiveness of clopidogrel depends on conversion to an active...",
