  "uses": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carvedilol tablets are an alpha/beta-adrenergic blocking agent indicated for the treatment of: mild to severe chronic heart failure ( 1.1 ) left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients( 1.2 ) hypertension( 1.3 ) 1.1 Heart Failure Carvedilol tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild-to-severe chronic heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis, to increase survival and, also, to reduce the risk of hospitalization [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 1.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction Carvedilol tablets are indicated to reduce cardiovascular mortality in clinically stable patients who have survived the acute phase of a myocardial infarction and have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% (with or without symptomatic heart failure) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . 1.3 Hypertension...",
  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take with food. Individualize dosage and monitor during up-titration. ( 2 ) Heart failure: Start at 3.125 mg twice daily and increase to 6.25, 12.5, and then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of at least 2 weeks. Maintain lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. ( 2.1 ) Left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase to 12.5 mg then 25 mg twice daily after intervals of 3 to 10 days. A lower starting dose or slower titration may be used.( 2.2 ) Hypertension: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase if needed for blood pressure control to 12.5 mg and then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of 1 to 2 weeks.( 2.3 ) Carvedilol should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects. 2.1 Heart Failure...",
  "common_side_effects": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events ( 6.1 ): Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (\u226510%): Dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, asthenia, bradycardia, weight increase. Hypertension (\u22655%): Dizziness. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1- 877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Carvedilol tablets have been evaluated for safety in subjects with heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe), in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction and in hypertensive subjects. The observed adverse event profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the subjects in the clinical trials....",
  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue. ( 5.1 ) Bradycardia, hypotension, worsening heart failure/fluid retention may occur. Reduce the dose as needed. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Non-allergic bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis and emphysema): Avoid \u03b2-blockers. ( 4 ) However, if deemed necessary, use with caution and at lowest effective dose. ( 5.5 ) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cessation of Therapy Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol tablets, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As...",
