  "drug_name": "Pravastatin Sodium",
  "drug_class": "Unknown Class",
  "uses": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. Pravastatin Sodium is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) indicated as an adjunctive therapy to diet to: Reduce the risk of MI, revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality in hypercholesterolemic patients without clinically evident CHD. (1.1) Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing coronary death, MI, revascularization, stroke/TIA, and the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with clinically evident CHD. (1.1) Reduce elevated Total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, and TG levels and to increase HDL\u00ad C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. (1.2) Reduce elevated serum TG levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia....",
  "dosage_info": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults: the recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. Use 80 mg dose only for patients not reaching LDL-C goal with 40 mg. (2.2) Significant renal impairment: the recommended starting dose is pravastatin 10 mg once daily. (2.3) Children (ages 8 to 13 years, inclusive): the recommended starting dose is 20 mg once daily. (2.4) Adolescents (ages 14 to 18 years): the recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. (2.4) 2.1 General Dosing Information The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Pravastatin Sodium and should continue on this diet during treatment with Pravastatin Sodium [see NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary therapy]. 2.2 Adult Patients The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. If a daily dose of 40 mg does not achieve desired cholesterol levels, 80 mg once daily is recommended. Pravastatin Sodium can be administered...",
  "common_side_effects": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Pravastatin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have usually been mild and transient. In 4-month-long placebo-controlled trials, 1.7% of pravastatin-treated patients and 1.2% of placebo-treated patients were discontinued from treatment because of adverse experiences attributed to study drug therapy; this difference was not statistically significant. In short-term clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22652% and > placebo) regardless of causality were: musculoskeletal pain, nausea/vomiting, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and headache. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Pharma Inc. at 1-866-924-6266 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Clinical Events Short-Term Controlled Trials In the Pravastatin Sodium placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 1313 patients (age range 20-76 years, 32.4% women, 93.5% Caucasians, 5% Blacks, 0.9% Hispanics, 0.4% Asians, 0.2% Others) with a median treatment duration of 14 weeks, 3.3% of patients on Pravastatin Sodium and 1.2% patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse...",
  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): predisposing factors include advanced age (\u226565), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician any unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Pravastatin therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. (5.1, 8.5) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): There have been rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment, positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy and improvement with immunosuppressive agents ( 5.2 ). Liver enzyme abnormalities: persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been...",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. (4.1, 6.2, 11) Active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations of serum transaminases. (4.2, 5.3 ) Pregnancy (4.3, 8.1, 8.3) Lactation (4.4, 8.2) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. 4.2 Liver Active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations of serum transaminases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 4.3 Pregnancy Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Since statins decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, they are contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers. PRAVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE...",
