  "serious_side_effects": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious risks related to overtreatment or undertreatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets: Titrate the dose of levothyroxine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration. (5.1) Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate levothyroxine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation. (2.3 , 5.2 , 8.5) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (5.3) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of levothyroxine sodium treatment. (5.4) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy. (5.5) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement...",

  "warnings": "WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS Thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine sodium, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) , Drug Interactions (7.7) , and Overdosage (10) ].
